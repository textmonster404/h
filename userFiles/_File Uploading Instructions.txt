Hi!
This is Josh.
In this directory, you may add a file to this folder any time.
I recommend bookmarking this as soon as possible.
Uploading files: Drag & Drop
Deleting files:
 1.  Add a blank file (perferrably a .txt file) that has the same name as the file you want to delete but with "delete " at the front of the name.
 2.  Wait for me to delete it myself.
Renaming files:
 1.  Add a blank file (perferrably a .txt file) called, "rename [your original file name here] to [new file name]".
 2.  Wait for me to rename the file.
 
 
 
Let's say I have uploaded a file named "potato.html".
I soon after want to rename it to "apple.php".
I upload a blank text file called "rename potato.html to apple.php.txt".
Later, Josh checks the directory and renames "potato.html" to "apple.php" and deletes "rename potato.html to apple.php.txt".
Now I want to delete "apple.php".
I upload a blank text file called "delete apple.php.txt".
Josh later deletes "apple.php" and "delete apple.php.txt".
