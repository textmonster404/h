        <p>I chose this question because is very simple and is unbiased. &nbsp;It will probably produce simple but meaningful data. &nbsp;I also think that my hypothesis is pretty good. &nbsp;I think that 8th graders have gone more times than 7th graders because they have had more opportunities to go to Westminster Woods than 7th graders. &nbsp;
